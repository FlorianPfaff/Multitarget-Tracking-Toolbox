# Multitarget Tracking Toolbox

Toolbox comprising certain established and novel multitarget trackers. The policy is to use existing functions (e.g., of the Sensor Fusion Toolbox) whereever it makes sense. The syntax is similar to libDirectional, on which this toolbox depends.

## Usage
Check out the git repository and the submodules for example via
```
git clone --recurse-submodules https://github.com/KIT-ISAS/Multitarget-Tracking-Toolbox/
```
Then, add all folders, including subfolders, to the Matlab path. For a usage example, see the test cases in ```GNNTest``` and ```KernelSMEFilterTest```.
